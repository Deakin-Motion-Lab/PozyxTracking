// AnchorIDs and Co-ordinates

// Notes: 
//    AnchorIDs are entered as Hexadecimal numbers (0xhhha), eg: 0x001a
//    Coordinates (x, y, z) are in mm and must be expressed in integers (whole numbers)
//        Negative numbers are acceptable (eg. -2500)
//    Anchor coordinates must be measured as accurately as possible
//    One anchor is defined as point of origin (0, 0, z) - typically the anchor connected to PC via USB cable
//    The remaining anchors' (x, y) position are defined relative to the origin anchor's (x, y)
//    All 'z' values (height) are measured from the ground / floor to top of anchor (location of UWB chip)
//    Enter values as: AnchorID,x,y,z
